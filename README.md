# ARKPlus
ARKPlus or A+ is a continuation of Structures Plus or S+.

The scope of A+ is to take what S+ was, fix some bugs, add some more configurations to further customize structures, and also a few extras.

A+ will stay an open source project just like S+ but will work in such a way that it will allow anyone with Ark Dev Kit knowledge to contribute to fixing bugs and suggest additional features to A+.

Keeping A+ as small as possible is a priority.  The goal for now is to keep A+ under a 50MB download on the Steam Workshop.
